# Insertion_Sort Android App

## Overview
This Android app implements the **Insertion Sort** algorithm to sort an array of integers between 0 and 9. The app reads input, processes the sorting algorithm, and outputs the result while displaying intermediate steps of the sorting process.

The app runs until the user inputs 'quit' to exit. It is built with Java and uses Groovy DSL for build configuration.


## Collaboration Guide

1. Before starting work on a new feature, use the ‘pull’ command to ensure your local main branch is updated with the latest changes.​
2. Create a new working branch from main using your first name followed by the feature name. For example: <br>
   `dalun-FE01-CreateSortingButton.`
3. Checkout your branch and working on the branch you created.
4. Ensure you do not make edits on the Main branch without informing others.
5. Before attempting to merge into the main branch, ensure that you have committed and pushed all changes from your local branch.
6. **Before merging, please ask Dalun or Kyle to review the changes.**
